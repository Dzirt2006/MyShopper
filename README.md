## [**MyShopper**](https://my-shopper.herokuapp.com/)

Hey honey, did you buy chia seeds for the salad? ...Ouch, I'll be right back! <br />
You'll never forget to buy what you need if you will control your buying process. 
Join your buying process with your family members and friends! Create shopping Pools and add products and stuff what you need to buy,
check it when you put it in your shopping cart and move forward without thinking that you can forget to take bread.
Make as many Pools as you need and add everything that you need to your Pool! That is your space. But don't be shy to share your party Pool with everybody at the party,
maybe someone wants to add an extra sweet, more sweets - more fun! 
See the product status in your party Pool in real-time and you won't buy a 21st watermelon, it will be someone who doesn't use MyShopper!
